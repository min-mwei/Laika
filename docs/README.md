# Laika Docs

Quick index for design and research notes.

- `docs/AIBrowser.md`: core architecture + security design for the Safari extension + app; current prototype UI uses a toolbar-toggled sidecar panel.
- `docs/AIBrowser_pitch.md`: product narrative and positioning.
- `docs/llm_tools.md`: tool-calling contract and tool catalog for Laika models.
- `docs/local_llm.md`: local model runtime and safety/perf guidance.

If you add a new doc, list it here. Keep entries short and focused on intent.
