# Laika Docs

Quick index for design and research notes.

- `docs/AIBrowser.md`: core architecture + security design for the Safari extension + app; current prototype UI uses a toolbar-toggled, attached sidecar panel in the active tab (with a standalone panel-window fallback when the sidecar can’t attach).
- `docs/AIBrowser_pitch.md`: product narrative and positioning.
- `src/laika/AGENTS.md`: build, run, automation, and test workflows for local development.
- `docs/llm_tools.md`: tool-calling contract and tool catalog for Laika models.
- `docs/local_llm.md`: local model runtime and safety/perf guidance.
- `docs/QWen3.md`: Qwen3 thinking/streaming/decoding one-pager.
- `docs/rendering.md`: Markdown subset rendering rules and UI sanitization pipeline.

If you add a new doc, list it here. Keep entries short and focused on intent.
